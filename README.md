# ForGeniusPy
Idk how to create an API nor script yet but I need that library

So basically I wanna start using lyricsgenius library for python to use songs
and to somehow generate lyrics.

To anyone who's good or knows python, I'm sorry if this seems wrong I might need some tips.

This'll be my first time creating a repository and the journey of this beginner has begun.

:D
