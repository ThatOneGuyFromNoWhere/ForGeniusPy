# My Projects
Idk how to create an API nor script yet but I need that library

------------------------------------------------

So basically I wanna start using lyricsgenius library for python to use songs
and to somehow generate lyrics.
To anyone who's good or knows python, I'm sorry if this seems wrong I might need some tips.
This'll be my first time creating a repository and the journey of this beginner has begun.

:D

Update: Same date, 4:30am

I have successfully linked it to Lyrics Genius.
Thanks Genius for the API Client!

------------------------------------------------

Still gonna continue doing some small projects and get used to some version control type of thing.
