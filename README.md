# My Projects

------------------------------------------------

I'll be turning this repository as my personal project packages for every programming language
that I know, this was also used as my redirectory URL for getting the Lyrics Genius API Client Registration.
I'm currently a 2nd year college student(2025-2026), and I'll be posting my previous codes from Codeblocks to
Visual Studio Code until I graduate and so on.

I'm quite used to C++ and Java. I'm still learning about JavaScript, C, and Python for Backend.
HTML and CSS along with JS for my Frontend roadmap, maybe Tailwind and React also.

:D

Update to Genius

I have successfully linked it to Lyrics Genius.
Thanks Genius for the API Client!

------------------------------------------------

You can suggest and give me advices for a better structure of any codes I'll be posting
and the default codes for each Programming Language that I used is just Hello World in
order to get some push and pull requests.
